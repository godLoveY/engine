/// When using Skia, Flutter creates Skia objects which are allocated in
/// WASM memory and which must be explicitly deleted. In the case of Flutter
/// mobile, the Skia objects are wrapped by a C++ class which is destroyed
/// when the associated Dart object is garbage collected.
///
/// On the web, we cannot tell when a Dart object is garbage collected, so
/// we must use other strategies to know when to delete a Skia object. Some
/// objects, like [ui.Paint], can safely delete their associated Skia object
/// because they can always recreate the Skia object from data stored in the
/// Dart object. Other objects, like [ui.Picture], can be serialized to a
/// JS-managed data structure when they are deleted so that when the associated
/// object is garbage collected, so is the serialized data.

/// - Zero or more cycles of delete + resurrect: when a Dart object is reused
///   after its C++ object is deleted we create a new C++ object populated with
///   data from the current state of the Dart object. This is done using the
///   [resurrect] method.
/// - Final delete: if a Dart object is never reused, it is GC'd after its
///   underlying C++ object is deleted. This is implemented by [SkiaObjects].
